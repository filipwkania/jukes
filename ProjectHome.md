[Jukes](http://melloware.com/products/jukes/index.html) was created for the serious music lover. This program was created for people who rip full CD's or possibly their entire CD collection to their hard drive. [Jukes](http://melloware.com/products/jukes/index.html) allows you to have all of your CD's at your fingertips and play them like a real jukebox. Perfect for DJ's, whether in your house or for parties or whatever, spin all of your favorite tunes anytime you want. No more loading the files in to play them and removing them to add more to the list, now all of your CD's are at your disposal!  [Jukes](http://melloware.com/products/jukes/index.html) is cross-platform and operates on Windows, Solaris, Linux, and MacOSX.

[Jukes](http://melloware.com/products/jukes/index.html) started out as Put Up Your Jukes! in 1998. It was originally written as a Borland Delphi Windows application and has served nicely for many years. However now in 2006 the software has run its course. There is no longer support for many of the libraries it uses, and most of the Delphi support around the web is slowly dissapearing. We had been experiencing some problems with newer ID3 tags and the library that Put Up Your Jukes! uses for tagging is no longer supported. I had never thought to rewrite it, much less rewrite it as a cross platform application because I felt the tools just were not there to make it as fast and stable as it is right now. I recently started noticing some quality cross platform apps that did not look like Java apps such as Azureus and Eclipse. It got me thinking I could rewrite it....

[Jukes](http://melloware.com/products/jukes/index.html) has been completely re-engineered after 7 years of experience using the old application. It is now a cross platform application that will work on Windows, Solaris, Linux, and MacOSX. It contains all the same great features that Put Up Your Jukes had, and much much more. See the New Features section to read more about the new features. Or check out the Screenshots and see for yourself.

In 2009 AZ Development joined the team and has been maintaining it since!
